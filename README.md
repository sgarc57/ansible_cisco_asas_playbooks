# Author: Steven Garcia

#
# I have recently added the example playbooks listed above
# check the .output files to see the output for the above commands
# I did have to force the local user account to be present when running  the above playbooks
#
# An example command would be like this:
# sudo su  admin -c "ansible-playbook  -vvv asa-command-test.yml"
#
# This worked successfully, without issue for cisco ASA
#
# Contact if any questions.
